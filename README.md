Hardware and software for ATMega based audio signal generator.

The signal generator produces Sine, Triangle, Sawtooth, Square and Pulse
waves in the frequency range from 2Hz to 20KHz. The output amplitude is
adjustable up to 10V peak. It has a multi line LCD display the shows the
frequency, waveform and output amplitude.

This project is in the early stages of development and although this version
works several enhancement are planed. I have some NE5532 heading my way on a
slow boat from China to replace the obsolete LM301s. Need to add trimmer pots
for calibrating the output voltage offset and amplitude. I also want to use
a faster processor to enhance the signal quality at frequencies above 10Khz.
